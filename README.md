# MedBench
___
We have proposed a new evaluation benchmark for Chinese medical language models called MedBench. It possesses the following characteristics: (1) Authenticity and Novelty. It exclusively utilizes expert-annotated electronic health records (EHRs) and up-to-date medical examinations to minimize contamination. (2) Comprehensiveness and Multi-facetedness. It is meticulously designed to align with Chinese medical standards and practices by incorporating three-stage multi-disciplinary examinations and real-world clinical cases. (3) Practicality. Human evaluation on actual clinical cases ensures consistency with the practical realities of medicine, while difficulty-stratified divisions in MedBench allow for rapid assessment.

## Overview
___
For better evaluating medical foundation models, this paper proposes MedBench as a large benchmark with 40,041 exercises originating from both authentic medical examinations and real-world diagnostic and treatment cases. Specifically, we collect three-stage medical examinations that serve as a faithful reflection of the comprehensive process involved in obtaining medical licenses in mainland China, exemplifying essential medical knowledge. Moreover, we construct a number of real-world cases based on electronic health records that provide examination plans, diagnoses, and treatments based on patientsâ€™ symptoms, which can reveal the medical knowledge utilization and reasoning capabilities of LLMs in the real world.
